# Eteria

Eteria is my attempt to make a production-ready multiplayer io game. The current test server can be found on https://eteria.herokuapp.com . I am constantly optimizing internal and client code so that the game does not "lag". Right now the game may seem barren and very simplistic, but I am planning to add features and mechanics once the optimization issues are fixed.
